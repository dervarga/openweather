## Weather forecast page

I created this small project for representational and practice purposes.
Techs:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript and jQuery
- OpenWeatherMap API
- OpenStreetMap (on OpenLayers)

I let many code comments in on purpose, I tried out many things. This project was a kind of sandbox.

### There is still room for improvement, for example:

- rendering the day names
- using i.e. GoogleMaps API, probably it would be probably faster than OpenStreetMap
- handling special characters (i.e.: á, é, í, ű, ő)
- handling time zones
